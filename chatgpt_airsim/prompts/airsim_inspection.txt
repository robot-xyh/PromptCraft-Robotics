Here are functions for infrastructure inspection with drone.

Basic drone control:
aw.takeoff() - takes off the drone.
aw.land() - lands the drone.
aw.fly_to([x, y, z]) - flies the drone to the position.
aw.fly_path(points) - flies the drone along the path.
aw.get_drone_position() - returns current position as [X, Y, Z].
aw.set_yaw(yaw) - sets yaw in degrees.
aw.get_yaw() - returns current yaw in degrees.
aw.get_position(object_name) - returns position of named object as [X, Y, Z].

Inspection functions:
aw.orbit(center, radius, altitude, speed, num_points) - flies circular orbit around a point.
  - center: [x, y] coordinates of center point
  - radius: orbit radius in meters
  - altitude: flight altitude (negative = up)
  - speed: flight speed in m/s
  - num_points: number of waypoints in orbit (more = smoother)

aw.inspect_object(object_name, distance, num_views) - captures images from multiple angles around an object.
  - Returns list of images from different viewpoints
  - distance: how far to position from object
  - num_views: number of viewing angles (default 4)

aw.survey_area(corner1, corner2, altitude, overlap) - flies lawnmower pattern over rectangular area.
  - corner1, corner2: opposite corners [x, y] of survey area
  - altitude: flight altitude (negative = up)
  - overlap: image overlap percentage (0.0-1.0)

Camera functions:
aw.get_image(camera_name, image_type) - gets camera image as numpy array.
aw.get_depth_image(camera_name) - gets depth image.
aw.save_image(filename, camera_name, image_type) - saves image to file.
aw.set_camera_orientation(camera_name, pitch, roll, yaw) - sets camera orientation in degrees.
aw.get_camera_orientation(camera_name) - gets camera orientation [pitch, roll, yaw] in degrees.

Object Detection:
aw.detect_objects(mesh_names, camera_name, radius_m) - detects objects matching patterns.
aw.draw_detections(camera_name, save_path) - gets image with detection boxes drawn.

Example - turbine inspection:
```python
# Get turbine position
pos = aw.get_position("turbine1")
# Fly to inspection altitude
aw.fly_to([pos[0], pos[1], -30])
# Orbit around turbine
aw.orbit(center=[pos[0], pos[1]], radius=15, altitude=-30, speed=3, num_points=12)
# Capture detailed images
images = aw.inspect_object("turbine1", distance=10, num_views=8)
```

Example - solar panel survey:
```python
pos = aw.get_position("solarpanels")
# Survey area around solar panels
aw.survey_area(
    corner1=[pos[0]-20, pos[1]-20],
    corner2=[pos[0]+20, pos[1]+20],
    altitude=-15,
    overlap=0.3
)
```

Infrastructure objects in scene:
turbine1, turbine2 - wind turbines
solarpanels - solar panel array
tower1, tower2, tower3 - transmission towers

Axis conventions: forward = positive X, right = positive Y, up = positive Z.
