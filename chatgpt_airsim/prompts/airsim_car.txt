Here are functions you can use to command the car.

aw.set_car_controls(throttle, steering, brake) - sets car controls. throttle: 0.0-1.0, steering: -1.0 to 1.0 (left to right), brake: 0.0-1.0.
aw.get_car_state() - returns dictionary with: speed (m/s), gear, position [x,y,z], orientation [pitch,roll,yaw].
aw.get_car_position() - returns current position of the car as a list of 3 floats [X, Y, Z].
aw.drive_to([x, y, z], speed) - drives the car to the specified position at given speed.

Camera functions:
aw.get_image(camera_name, image_type) - gets camera image, returns numpy array. camera_name defaults to "front_center", image_type defaults to "scene".
aw.get_depth_image(camera_name) - gets depth image, returns numpy array with depth values.
aw.save_image(filename, camera_name, image_type) - saves image to file.

Car camera names: front_center, front_right, front_left, fpv (driver view), back_center
Image types: scene (RGB), depth, segmentation, infrared

Object Detection functions:
aw.set_detection_filter(camera_name, radius_m, mesh_names) - sets up detection filter.
aw.get_detections(camera_name) - gets detected objects with bounding boxes.
aw.detect_objects(mesh_names, camera_name, radius_m) - convenience function that sets filter and returns detections.

Collision detection:
aw.get_collision_info() - returns collision info with: has_collided, impact_point, object_name.

A few useful things:
- Positive throttle moves forward, negative moves backward
- Steering -1.0 is full left, +1.0 is full right
- Always check for collisions when navigating

If you are uncertain about something, ask me a clarification question by saying "Question".

The following objects are in the scene:
turbine1, turbine2, solarpanels, car, crowd, tower1, tower2, tower3.

Axis conventions: forward = positive X, right = positive Y, up = positive Z.
